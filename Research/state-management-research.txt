1. Title or name of research/training: 

	State Management
	
	

2. Why are you doing it?

	I am researching state management in order to better understand what is necessary for a user to be able to navigate our software in real time.
	
	

3. What you expect to learn/do. Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training.

	Specifically, I would like to design and implement a pause/resume feature to 'freeze' the 2D-Engine in order to observe individual frames and
	
	their existing entities in greater detail.
	
	To achieve this goal I aim to use a conventional game development *State Pattern, which is an OOP framework consisting of a manager parent class
	
	and its (state type) children.
	
	

4. What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.

	The classes I would like to create following the framework described would look something similar to the following:
	
		Parent: EngineState
			
			Methods: update(), draw()
			
			Children(Abstraction/Inheritence): RunningState, StoppedState
				
				Methods: update(), draw(), etc.

	*A simple, yet more detailed example shown as a UML Diagram can be found in the blog linked at the bottom of this document.
	
	**A short video visualizing something similar to the intended result is included at the bottom of this document.
	
	
5. What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training: 

	Design/Implement StateManager class
	Design/Implement RunningState and StoppedState classes
