1. Title or name of research/training: 
- I want to learn more about CMake and PreMake to be able to run and manage multiples files of our project and added dependency's to make running our project much more easier.

  2. Why you are doing it.
- To future proof our project by organizing the dependencies and files of our program early so that when we extend our project, it will save lots of time with making it easier to build our program.


  3. What you expect to learn/do.   Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training.
  - Get a basic understanding of CMake script to be able to test and create an example with our current code to then make building our code much more compatible with different systems. 



   4. What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.

   - I'll attempt to write a CMake script to add our dependency's and attempt to build the current files that we have to make sure it's working properly and whether or not it's a viable option if we want to use it as our project grows.


   5. What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training:
   -SCRUM-38CMake_and_Setting up tools
