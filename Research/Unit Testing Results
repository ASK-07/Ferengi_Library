Using code from object interaction implementation, I am looking to create different shapes
and using a data structure apply different forces on specific objects. 

Results:
	1. Created a working *pointer* function to "arbitrarily" create different shapes.
	   ~function works as intended.
	   ~Users can pick either circle or rectangle, might include other shapes offered by SFML,
	    might be able to create our own shapes using the framework.
	   ~Could implement a button system which can use the same function as current controls 
	    (num1 = circle; num2 = rectangle)

	2. Created a working array which takes in created shapes in order to apply different forces.
	   ~function works as intended
	   
	   Issues: 
			Gravity seems to be overpowering external forces, fix might include rewriting gravity 
			function.
			Possibly issues within the data structure itself, having difficulties displaying 
			anything on the console.
