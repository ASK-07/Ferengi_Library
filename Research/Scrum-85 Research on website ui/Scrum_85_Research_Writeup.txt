1. Title or name of research/training

Implementation of HTML + CSS websites

2. Why you are doing it.

No one in my team is experienced implementing HTML and CSS files to create webpages, which is an important part of our project.

3. What you expect to learn/do.   

I expect to learn how to implement these files in a way that deviates from our flask app template noticably. 

4. What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  

I want to update the classes for our text, containers, body, and menu, as well as use images in the about page. I want to add a little image of Ferengi as our homepage button in our menu to create a sense of humor in the design as well.

4. What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.

Scrum 88, 91, 92, 93
