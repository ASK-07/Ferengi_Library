1. Title or name of research/training:

Connecting to MongoDB Using Flask-PyMongo Drivers



2. Why are you doing it.

The purpose of this research document is to provide clarification for how to connect to the remote database.



3. What you expect to learn/do. Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training.

This document aims to provide documentation for how to generate a MONGO_URI key in order to connect to the remote database through the flask app.

Through this research, we will learn what structure the connection string must conform to in order to connect to our database through the particular drivers we are using.

The confusion could lay within the difference between the native PyMongo drivers, and the more specialized flask-pymongo drivers.

As I understand, the native PyMongo drivers require more *dependencies than the flask-pymongo drivers.

When using the native drivers with the *dependencies, reading/writing to the database should work as expected.

I believe the flask-pymongo ddrivers that are currently being used will work if we are able to correctly configure our connection strings.



4. What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.

The RESTful API is partially implemented, but we are unable to read/write to the database through the flask app until a valid connection is established.
Once this issue is solved, the API should work as expected.



5. What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training:

All tasks are reliant on finding a solution through this research, across multiple User Stories...

Making this issue a top priority.
